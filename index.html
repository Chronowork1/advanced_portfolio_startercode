      <p>Although, I'm no professional at programming just yet. I practice and learn new programs every day. Prgramming is defintely challenging in the beginning however practice makes perfect.</p>
      <p>Hello, my name is Jian Xie. I've been programming since the start of 2017 but decided to do Software Engineering as a career in September of 2018. To this day I was influenced by ScriptEd /CodeNation. Throughout the time I've been programming, I met incredible people that assist me along the way. I hope to continue this path of becoming a software engineer.
        Specializes in mostly Front-End Software Engineering using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        Currently learning Back-End Software Engineering and Databases.</p>
      <p>Hello my name is Jian Xie. 
        I’ve been programming since the start of 2017 but decided to pursue programming as a career in September of 2018. 
        Currently I am a student enhancing my programming skills and I am looking for a opportunity to connect and hopefully get a position in the tech industry either a internship, web-developer or front-end software engineer position after Dev Mission. 
        I specializes in HTML, CSS, and Javascript and other Javascript Libraries mostly, Front-End technology  which can sort of see on my project but also working on my Back-end and learning about databases.
        I also worked as a teacher’s assistant in high school which basically assist the teacher in many tasks such as printing, stacking and copying which shows diligent and detail-orientation. Having these skills, I think I work well in both teams and individually.
